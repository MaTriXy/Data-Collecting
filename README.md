# Data-Collecting
Data crawlers and scripts to data collecting used during the PhD. Course

Usually I need to collect data during in a data-wars style ;)
This script are a simple courtesy of weapons to this battle.

Actually the project provides the following files:
  - Foursquare Venues Crawler: HTML parser to collect data from venues pages of Foursquare app
  - Twitter Monitor based on Geolocation: simple crawler to collect data from Twitter Stream API
  - OpenSignal Crawler: crawler to collect data of cellphone antenas and quality of signal from OpenSignal project
  - Chicago Traffic Tracker: continously check the JSON provided by CTA dept. about the Chicago Traffic

OBS: all the scripts are python and use some external packages/modules or need a specific input file. 
Feel free to extend your project based on my code.
